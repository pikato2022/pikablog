Hi, I'm Evey. I'm a data engineer, working in Singapore. I help bring data in from different sources in batch or real-time manner. Beside data pipeline, I maintain and develop in house or cloud data platform components. I'm really interested in solving problem with different kind of datas.

Beside tech, I love playing with my cat. I'm addicted to my cat, Carlito!
